#The Quakers vindicated from the calumnies of those that falsly accuse them as if they denyed magistrates, and disowned government; and as if both in principle and practice they were inconsistant with either. In which is shewed, that the true and sincere Quakers (so called, for of them I write) are in the spirit and principle in which the justice of magistrates is obeyed, and in which magistrates are to administer their government, and that by their practice in good works they fulfill all just and good government. And that they have God's authority for their meeting together to worship Him, ... And that people in matters of religion and the worship of God, should rather be instructed and led by the Spirit of the Lord in Gods authority, ... Also, several objections answered, as to the exercise of secular force and compulsion over the conscience in matters of faith, religion, and the worship of God. By Edward Pyot.#
